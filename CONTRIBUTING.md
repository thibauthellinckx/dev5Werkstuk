## Enforcement
- If you violate a rule, depending on the action you will first get a warning (private). If you continue to break the rules, you will get a second warning. This time it will be a public one.
- If you continue to misbehave or you do something that is extremely against our rules, you will immediately get suspended for a certain period.
- If you continue to do things against the rules, even after your suspension, you will get a permanent ban.
## Bug reporting

I encourage people to report bugs. Before you report a bug, first read these steps: 1) do as thorough a search as you can to see whether the bug has already been reported, and 2) be as precise and complete as you can when reporting a new bug.

To report a bug:

1. Go to the project.

2. Click the Issues button on the left of the window.

3. Click the "New issue" button.

4. Fill out the Title and Description. You don't need to fill out the other fields.
