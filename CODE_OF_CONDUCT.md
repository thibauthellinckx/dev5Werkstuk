## Rules
-Be kind and respectful towards each other, even if your opinion doesn't match someone else's. 
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback 
- If you made a mistake and someone is affected by that, apologize and accept responibility. I believe this is the better method to learn from experiences.

## Where the rules are applied
Pretty much everywhere in the project on github.

## Consequences for violation
- Your request/comment/code/issues,... can be denied or even removed in some cases.
- Depending on the case, appropriate actions will be taken.

## How to report a violation
- You can always report a violation of the rules via thibaut.hellinckx@student.ehb.be

## Enforcement
- If you violate a rule, depending on the action you will first get a warning (private). If you continue to break the rules, you will get a second warning. This time it will be a public one.
- If you continue to misbehave or you do something that is extremely against our rules, you will immediately get suspended for a certain period.
- If you continue to do things against the rules, even after your suspension, you will get a permanent ban.
